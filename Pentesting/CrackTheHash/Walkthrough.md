First, I added the hash to the file md5 and specify the format(md5)
It only works if you put the hash into a file

Same here but I didn't put the format and it works

Same with format SHA256

I also tried with:

But the first hash wasn't recognized by hashid, cyberchef, crackstation, etc. The second hash was recognized only by crackstation, so it's important to use different tools to identify the format.

The fifth hash with MD4 format

Next step, lvl 2

There are also hashes but more complex, the first one:

Using hashID was recognized as SHA256, the results was:

Also with john

The second hash was detected by john as LM, but didn't support that format so I tried with hashID to know the possible format:

So maybe would be NTLM, let's try with crackstation

This one took more time to crack 

The last one was made like this:

Some of the hashes couldn't get cracked bc the tool sometimes got into a loop
