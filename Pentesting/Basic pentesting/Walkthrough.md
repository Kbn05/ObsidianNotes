Found a possible ssh hash to sudo user

![[Pasted image 20231203221433.png]]
Yeah, it's actually a hash so we copy-paste to our host

![[Pasted image 20231203221650.png]]
I tried to crack the hash lmao but it's better to login with it XD
(I tried again btw, just out of curiosity)

![[Pasted image 20231203223617.png]]
I had to change the perm of the file and tried again, but it asked for a passphrase, so was necessary to crack the hash

![[Pasted image 20231203223756.png]]
To do that, we locate the file ssh2john and converted the hash into a format to crack. Finally, the passphrase was beeswax.

Logged into the system and got the flag. Also verified the user permissions

It shows that kay can run all commands, so I tried to get a root shell with vim using:

:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

But I didn't realize that kay couldn't run vim as root, so it gave me the same shell xd
